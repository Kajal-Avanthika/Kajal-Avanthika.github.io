What is Microprocessor?
A Microprocessor is an important part of a computer architecture without which you will not be able to perform anything on your computer. It is a programmable device that takes in input performs some arithmetic and logical operations over it and produces the desired output. In simple words, a Microprocessor is a digital device on a chip that can fetch instructions from memory, decode and execute them, and give results. 

A Microprocessor takes a bunch of instructions in machine language and executes them, telling the processor what it has to do. The microprocessor performs three basic things while executing the instruction: 

It performs some basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and some logical operations using its Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU). New Microprocessors also perform operations on floating-point numbers. 
Data in microprocessors can move from one location to another. 
It has a Program Counter (PC) register that stores the address of the next instruction based on the value of the PC, Microprocessor jumps from one location to another and makes decisions.

Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)

CISC or Complex Instruction Set Computer is a computer architecture where instructions are such that a single instruction can execute multiple low-level operations like loading from memory, storing into memory, or an arithmetic operation, etc. It has multiple addressing nodes within a single instruction. CISC makes use of very few registers. 

Example of CISC are

Intel 386 

Intel 486  

Pentium 
 
Pentium Pro 

Pentium II 

Pentium III 

Motorola 68000 etc
